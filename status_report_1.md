# Status Report - Dash Community

An open platform that incentivizes collaborative content and projects 

### Overview

##### Status Summary
I have accomplished all items in the scope to the present date, on time, and within budget.  See below for details.

##### Project Reminder

This proposal is to fund the creation and maintenance of what I'm calling "Dash Community".  **Dash Community** is an open platform that incentivizes collaborative projects and content, using a transparent, powerful, and relatively easy-to-use hosting service, i.e. Github.  

The primary motivation for this project is to increase the value of Dash.  Details of the proposal can be found at the [proposal's landing page](https://dashcommunity.github.io/proposal-dash-community/).

### Closing
If the project is funded I will develop another separate proposal to continue supporting the project into future months.  The scope, schedule, and budget for that revision will be based on community feedback.  

This project can grow as large as we wish.  The more financial incentive we can offer the more expansive the platform will become, which will lead to a healthier, more decentralized ecosystem.  The platform is ideal for

* **developers** (projects that need to host code)
* **writers** (of blogs, guides, etc.)
* marketers or **anyone** who wishes to host community funded files and content on a powerful, transparent platform
