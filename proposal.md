# Proposal - Dash Commmunity

Open collaboration for dash-related projects

### Overview

> "Having lots of people involved with Dash is what makes it successful!" - Evan Duffield

This proposed project aims to get more people actively involved with dash.  Like every cryptocurrency project, dash's strength is the degree to which it becomes and remains decentralized and open.  This project will help lead dash in that direction.

Many people are eager to contribute to the dash project.  Many are not sure where and how to begin.  The **Dash Community** project I'm proposing **is a place where anyone can join and contribute their time and talents, using a collaborative, transparent, work-oriented platform**.  This [Github organization](https://github.com/dashcommunity) and repositories therein is that place.  

There are many useful tools and resources in the dash ecosystem
* [Dash.org](https://www.dash.org/) and the accompanying [forum](https://www.dash.org/forum/)
* The [official project documentation](https://dashpay.atlassian.net/wiki/display/DOC/Official+Documentation)
* The main [dashpay Github repository](https://github.com/dashpay)
* Varous Slack teams and channels
* Varous Community-produced sites
  * [dash central](https://www.dashcentral.org/)
  * [dash vote tracker](http://dashvotetracker.com/)
* and more

The resources above are very helpful for reference and use, but are somewhat restricted in terms of general community accessibility.  The community cannot directly help build on and improve these resources.  An open platform would provide opportunities for individuals and teams to build products and services that anyone else can easily contribute to.  This [Github organization](https://github.com/dashcommunity) is that platform.


### Scope

Some of the Dash Community infrastructure (this Github organization and repositories within) has already been built.  This proposal is a request for reimbursement of the cost incurred (time spent) bringing it to the present state, as well as a request for further funding to imporve it, and support the community in using it.

The following sub-sections will list what I've accomplished, what I plan to do throughout the month (during voting), and what I plan to do contingent on project funding.  This proposal will remain static after submission, but I will be continually updating [the project management board](https://github.com/dashcommunity/proposal-dash-community/projects/1).  My requested budget will remain fixed, but the effort and deliverables you can expect may increase.  Stop by occassionally, or [Watch](https://github.com/dashcommunity/proposal-dash-community/subscription) the repo for updates.

### Budget

Total proposed project costs are summarized in Table 2. 

The costs to perform the deliverables and milestones above are based on expected (and expended) time required to perform the item, along with a given billable rate.  All of this work is exclusively my own, and is billed at 5 DASH/hr. Details are shown in Table 3.

In addition to my time, I would like to compensate community members for their time and interest in the project.  I am proposing to pay all community members who join and contribute at least one meaningful commit to the organization.  Rates for this are proposed in Table 4.

##### Terms

I am requesting **one single paymnet of 250 DASH** to cover the following: 

* the preceeding month's work (September)
* the month during voting (October)
* and support into the next month if the proposal passes (November)
* community participation rewards (November)

### Closing

This community effort can grow as big or as small as we wish.  The more financial incentive we can offer the community the better and more expansive the platform and community will become, which will lead to a healthier, more decentralized community.  This platform will be ideal for

* **developers** (projects that need to host code)
* **writers** (of blogs, guides, etc.)
* marketers or **anyone** who wishes to host community funded files and content on a powerful, transparent platform
