# Status Report - Dash Community

##### Status Summary
In total, **22 people have joined** the Dash Community gihub organization.  In addition to those who have joined there are 4 pending invites to people who have requested to join.  People were asked to take a small survey when they signed up.  One of the questions asked which aspect of the project they were interested in, as shown below:

Some also gave open ended feedback about the project:

Although we've had many people join the organization, relatively few have made contributions.  I suspect this is mainly due to the project being new and not user friendly enough.  The process for creating blog posts and guides is still too difficult and the landing pages need significant improvment.  I plan on making several changes to this end starting tomorrow, and I will update this status report accordingly.  Stay tuned.    

##### Project Reminder

This proposal is to fund the creation and maintenance of what I'm calling "Dash Community".  **Dash Community** is an open platform that incentivizes collaborative projects and content, using a transparent, powerful, and relatively easy-to-use hosting service, i.e. Github.  

The primary motivation for this project is to increase the value of Dash.  Details of the proposal can be found at the [proposal's landing page](https://dashcommunity.github.io/proposal-dash-community/). 

### Scope

###### Remaining Deliverables

1. Continued community support
2. Update this status report when new landing pages and updated guides are available
3. Proposal with re-scoped project (according to community and masternode operator feedback/desires)
4. Payments to people who join and make at least one meaningful commit to the organization

*Note: I had originally planned to send a re-scoped proposal for continued funding of this project (for next month), but decided it would be better to get the project more fine tuned, with more feedback before making that.  I will deliver that either later this month or next month.*

### Payments
Payments to those who have participated (and will later) will be delivered on schedule.  I'm hopeful that we'll have more join through this month, but if not all funds will still be disbursed (see table below for details).
