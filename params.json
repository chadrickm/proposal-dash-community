The [`dashcommunity` organization](https://github.com/dashcommunity) hosts repositories for various purposes - something for everyone.  I'm proposing it in order to increase community contribution and continue the general decentralization of Dash.  It will achieve this by lowering the barrier to entry and raising the [financial incentive](https://github.com/dashcommunity/proposal-dash-community/blob/master/proposal.md#table-4---compensation-for-community-participation) for software developers, writers, marketers, and anyone else to use and contribute to Dash.\r\n\r\nI'm requesting **one single payment of 250 DASH** for this project.  This covers primarily my own time, but 20% of the total will be redistributed back to community members who participate in the project.  \r\n\r\n##### Motivation\r\n\r\n> \"Having lots of people involved with Dash is what makes it successful!\" - Evan Duffield\r\n\r\nThe primary motivation for this project is to increase the value of Dash.  As Evan's sentiment above suggests, I believe this is best achieved through sustainable community growth.  For growth to be sustainable, two things are required:\r\n\r\n* increase community contribution\r\n* decrease project centralization\r\n\r\nThe two go hand in hand; Dash becomes more decentralized as independent community members contribute to it.  This is obvious to some, but it bears repeating and expounding upon.  I have begun to make the case more explicit in this [blog post about decentralization](https://github.com/dashcommunity/blog/blob/master/shift_to_decentralization.md).\r\n\r\nMany people are eager to contribute to Dash, but many are not sure where or how to begin.  Or, they know where and how, but they cannot financially justify altruistically contributing to the project.  To increase community contribution, two things are required:\r\n\r\n* lower the barrier to entry\r\n* raise the incentive to enter\r\n\r\nThere are many useful tools and resources in the Dash ecosystem:\r\n* [Dash.org](https://www.dash.org/) and the accompanying [forum](https://www.dash.org/forum/)\r\n* The [official project documentation](https://dashpay.atlassian.net/wiki/display/DOC/Official+Documentation)\r\n* The [main dashpay Github repository](https://github.com/dashpay)\r\n* Community-produced sites\r\n  * [dash central](https://www.dashcentral.org/)\r\n  * [dash vote tracker](http://dashvotetracker.com/)\r\n* Slack teams, and more\r\n\r\nThese resources are very helpful for reference and use, but are somewhat restricted in terms of accessibility and contribution.  The community cannot directly help build on and improve these resources.  An open platform would provide opportunities for individuals and teams to build products and services that anyone else can easily contribute to and integrate with.  Dash new-comers will benefit from the additional learning resources produced ([guides](https://github.com/dashcommunity/guides), [blog posts](https://github.com/dashcommunity/blog), etc).  This *lowers the barrier to entry* for both experienced content creators and interested new-comers.\r\n\r\nA portion of the funds requested for this project will be distributed to people who join and contribute to Dash Community.  This *raises the incentive to enter* as a Dash contributor.  The lowered barrier and raised incentive increase participation, which yields a more decentralized project, which sustainably raises the value of Dash.\r\n\r\n### Scope\r\n\r\nPart of the Dash Community infrastructure (the Github organization and repositories within) has already been built, part is planned, but not yet built, and much more is possible.  This proposal is a request for reimbursement for the cost incurred (time spent) bringing it to the present state, as well as a request for further funding to improve it and support the community in using it.\r\n\r\nThe following sub-sections will list what I've accomplished, what I plan to do throughout the month (during voting), and what I plan to do contingent on project funding.  This document (the proposal) may remain unedited once submitted, but I will be continually updating [the project management board](https://github.com/dashcommunity/proposal-dash-community/projects/1?fullscreen=true) throughout this and next month.  My requested budget is fixed, but the effort and deliverables you can expect from me will likely increase if there is interest.

All of this work is exclusively my own, and is billed at 5 DASH/hr. Details are shown in Table 3.\r\n\r\nIn addition to my time, I would like to compensate community members.  I propose paying all community members who join and contribute at least one meaningful commit to the organization.  Proposed rates are shown in Table 4. \r\n\r\n##### Itemized Costs\r\n\r\n###### Table 2 - Cost Summary\r\n|     Item                    |    Cost  |   Units  |   Comment    |\r\n|-----------------------------|:--------:|:--------:|--------------|\r\n| Deliverables                |    200   |   DASH   | See Table 3  |\r\n| Community Partcipation      |     50   |   DASH   | See Table 4  |\r\n| **Total**                   |  **250** | **DASH** |              |\r\n\r\n###### Table 3 - Compensation for Deliverables\r\n|  Cost    | Desc.            | Time Est | Rate (D/hr) | Cost (DASH)  |   Comment                |\r\n|----------|------------------|:--------:|:-----------:|:------------:|--------------------------|\r\n| C1       | D1.1 - D1.7      | 40 hr(s) |    5 DASH   |   200 DASH   | Work to date             |\r\n| C2       | D2.1 - D2.4      | 20 hr(s) |    5 DASH   |   100 DASH   | Projected October work   |\r\n| C3       | D3.1 - D3.5      | 20 hr(s) |    5 DASH   |   100 DASH   | Projected November work  |\r\n| C4       | Proposal fee     |          |    5 DASH   |     5 DASH   | Reimburse this proposal  |\r\n|*Subtotal*|                  |          |             |  *405 DASH*  |                          |\r\n| Discount |                  |          |             |  -205 DASH   | >50% off, I love Dash!   |\r\n|**Total** |                  |          |             | **200 DASH** |                          |\r\n\r\n###### Table 4 - Compensation for Community Participation\r\n|   Cost  |    Description    |  Reward  |   Cost     |          Comment                       |\r\n|---------|-------------------|:--------:|:----------:|----------------------------------------|\r\n| C5      | First 10 people...| 1.0 DASH |  10 DASH   | ...who make 1 or more commits          |\r\n| C6      | Next 20 people... | 0.5 DASH |  10 DASH   | ...who make 1 or more commits          |\r\n| C7      | Remaining people  |          |  10 DASH   | split between remaining who join       |\r\n| C8      | Discretionary     |          |  20 DASH   | for great content (blogs, guides, etc) |\r\n|**Total**|                   |          |**50 DASH**|                                         |\r\n\r\n##### Terms\r\nI am requesting **one single payment of 250 DASH** to cover the following: \r\n\r\n* the preceeding month's work (September)\r\n* deliverables and support through this month (October)\r\n* deliverables and support through next month if the proposal passes (November)\r\n* community participation compensation (November)\r\n\r\n### Closing\r\nIf the project is funded I will develop another separate proposal to continue supporting the project into future months.  The scope, schedule, and budget for that revision will be based on community feedback.  \r\n\r\nThis project can grow as large as we wish.  The more financial incentive we can offer the more expansive the platform will become, which will lead to a healthier, more decentralized ecosystem.  The platform is ideal for\r\n\r\n* **developers** (projects that need to host code)\r\n* **writers** (of blogs, guides, etc.)\r\n* marketers or **anyone** who wishes to host community funded files and content on a powerful, transparent platform\r\n\r\n> \"Anyone, with any skill set (software, quality assurance, automation, admin, marketing, legal, etc) is needed.\" - Evan Duffield\r\n",
