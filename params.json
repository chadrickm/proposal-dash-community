Like every cryptocurrency project, dash's strength is the degree to which it becomes and remains decentralized and open.  This project will help lead dash in that direction.\r\n\r\nMany people are eager to contribute to the dash project.  Many are not sure where and how to begin.  The **Dash Community** project I'm proposing **is a place where anyone can join and contribute their time and talents, using a collaborative, transparent, work-oriented platform**.  This [Github organization](https://github.com/dashcommunity) and repositories therein is that place.  \r\n\r\nThere are many useful tools and resources in the dash ecosystem\r\n* [Dash.org](https://www.dash.org/) and the accompanying [forum](https://www.dash.org/forum/)\r\n* The [official project documentation](https://dashpay.atlassian.net/wiki/display/DOC/Official+Documentation)\r\n* The main [dashpay Github repository](https://github.com/dashpay)\r\n* Varous Slack teams and channels\r\n* Varous Community-produced sites\r\n  * [dash central](https://www.dashcentral.org/)\r\n  * [dash vote tracker](http://dashvotetracker.com/)\r\n* and more\r\n\r\nThe resources above are very helpful for reference and use, but are somewhat restricted in terms of general community accessibility.  The community cannot directly help build on and improve these resources.  An open platform would provide opportunities for individuals and teams to build products and services that anyone else can easily contribute to.  This [Github organization](https://github.com/dashcommunity) is that platform.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Scope\r\n\r\nSome of the Dash Community infrastructure (this Github organization and repositories within) has already been built.  This proposal is a request for reimbursement of the cost incurred (time spent) bringing it to the present state, as well as a request for further funding to imporve it, and support the community in using it.\r\n\r\nThe following sub-sections will list what I've accomplished, what I plan to do throughout the month (during voting), and what I plan to do contingent on project funding.  This proposal will remain static after submission, but I will be continually updating [the project management board](https://github.com/dashcommunity/proposal-dash-community/projects/1).  My requested budget will remain fixed, but the effort and deliverables you can expect may increase.  Stop by occassionally, or [Watch](https://github.com/dashcommunity/proposal-dash-community/subscription) the repo for updates.\r\n\r\n##### Deliverables\r\n\r\n###### Completed Deliverables (D1.x)\r\n\r\n1.

All of this work is exclusively my own, and is billed at 5 DASH/hr. Details are shown in Table 3.\r\n\r\nIn addition to my time, I would like to compensate community members for their time and interest in the project.  I am proposing to pay all community members who join and contribute at least one meaningful commit to the organization.  Rates for this are proposed in Table 4. \r\n\r\n##### Itemized Costs\r\n\r\n###### Table 2 - Cost Summary\r\n|     Item     |    Cost  |   Units  |   Comment    |\r\n|--------------|:--------:|:--------:|--------------|\r\n| Deliverables |    200   |   DASH   | See Table 3  |\r\n| Community    |     50   |   DASH   | See Table 4  |\r\n| **Total**    |  **250** | **DASH** |              |\r\n\r\n###### Table 3 - Compensation for Deliverables\r\n|  Cost    | Desc.   | Time Est | Rate (D/hr) | Cost (DASH)  |   Comment     |\r\n|----------|-------- |:--------:|:-----------:|:------------:|---------------|\r\n| C1       | M1      | 36 hr(s) |    5 DASH   |   180 DASH   |               |\r\n| C2       | M2      | 10 hr(s) |    5 DASH   |    50 DASH   |               |\r\n| C3       | M3      |  4 hr(s) |    5 DASH   |    20 DASH   |               |\r\n| C4       | M4      |  2 hr(s) |    5 DASH   |    10 DASH   |               |\r\n| C5       | M5      |  5 hr(s) |    5 DASH   |    25 DASH   |               |\r\n| C6       | M6      |  0 hr(s) |    5 DASH   |     0 DASH   |               |\r\n| C7       | M7      |  3 hr(s) |    5 DASH   |    15 DASH   |               |\r\n|*Subtotal*|         |          |             |  *300 DASH*  |               |\r\n| Discount |         |          |             |  -100 DASH   | I love dash!  |\r\n|**Total** |         |          |             | **200 DASH** |               |\r\n\r\n###### Table 4 - Compensation for Community Participation\r\n|   Cost  |    Description    |  Reward  |   Cost     |          Comment                       |\r\n|---------|-------------------|:--------:|:----------:|----------------------------------------|\r\n| C8      | First 10 people...| 1.0 DASH |  10 DASH   | ...who make 1 or more commits          |\r\n| C9      | Next 20 people... | 0.5 DASH |  10 DASH   | ...who make 1 or more commits          |\r\n| C10     | Remaining people  |          |  10 DASH   | split between remaining who join       |\r\n| C11     | Discretionary     |          |  20 DASH   | for great content (blogs, guides, etc) |\r\n|**Total**|                   |          |**50 DASH**|                                         |\r\n\r\n##### Terms\r\n\r\nI am requesting **one single paymnet of 250 DASH** to cover the following: \r\n\r\n* the preceeding month's work (September)\r\n* the month during voting (October)\r\n* and support into the next month if the proposal passes (November)\r\n* community participation rewards (November)\r\n\r\n### Closing\r\n\r\nThis community effort can grow as big or as small as we wish.  The more financial incentive we can offer the community the better and more expansive the platform and community will become, which will lead to a healthier, more decentralized community.  This platform will be ideal for\r\n\r\n* **developers** (projects that need to host code)\r\n* **writers** (of blogs, guides, etc.)\r\n* marketers or **anyone** who wishes to host community funded files and content on a powerful, transparent platform\r\n\r\n> \"Anyone, with any skill set (software, quality assurance, automation, admin, marketing, legal, etc) is needed.\" - Evan Duffield\r\n",
