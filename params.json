Many are not sure where and how to begin.  The **Dash Community** project I'm proposing **is a place where anyone can join and contribute their time and talents, using a collaborative, transparent, work-oriented platform**, i.e. Github.  \r\n\r\nThere are many useful tools and resources in the dash ecosystem\r\n* The dash homepage\r\n * The dash forum\r\n* The official documentation\r\n* The main Github repository\r\n* Varous Slack team and channels\r\n* Varous Community-produced sites\r\n  * [dash central](https://www.dashcentral.org/)\r\n  * [dash vote tracker](http://dashvotetracker.com/)\r\n* and more\r\n\r\nThe resources above are very helpful for reference and use, but are somewhat restricted in terms of general community accessibility.  An open platform would provide opportunities for individuals and teams to build products and services that anyone else can easily help improve and contribute to.  \r\n\r\nLike every cryptocurrency project, dash's strength is the degree to which it becomes and remains decentralized and open.  This project will help lead dash in that direction.\r\n\r\n### Scope\r\n\r\nSome of the Dash Community infrastructure has already been built.  This proposal is a request for reimbursement of the cost (time) required to bring it to the present state (conceptualization/planning, execution/writing, revisions, etc), as well as a request for further funding to imporve and support it.\r\n\r\nThe following sub-sections will list what I've accomplished, what I plan to do throughout the month (during voting), and what I plan to do contingent on project funding.  Although this proposal's list will remain static, I will be continually updating [the project management board](https://github.com/dashcommunity/proposal-riongull-2016-10-06/projects/1).  My requested budget will remain fixed, but the deliverables you can expect may increase.  Check in anytime to see updates.\r\n\r\n##### Deliverables\r\n\r\n###### Completed (D1)\r\n1.

All of this work is exclusively my own, and is billed at 5 DASH/hr. Details are shown in Table 3.\r\n\r\nIn addition to my time, I would like to compensate community members for their time and interest in the project.  I am proposing to pay all community members who join and contribute at least one meaningful commit to the organization.  Rates for this are proposed in Table 4. \r\n\r\n##### Itemized Costs\r\n\r\n###### Table 2 - Cost Summary\r\n|     Item     |    Cost  |   Units  |   Comment    |\r\n|--------------|:--------:|:--------:|--------------|\r\n| Deliverables |    175   |   DASH   | See Table 3  |\r\n| Community    |     50   |   DASH   | See Table 4  |\r\n| **Total**    |  **225** | **DASH** |              |\r\n\r\n###### Table 3 - Compensation for Deliverables\r\n| Time Costs | Desc.    | Time Est | Rate (D/hr) | Cost (DASH)  |   Comment           |\r\n|------------|--------- |:--------:|:-----------:|:------------:|---------------------|\r\n| TC 1       | MS 1     | 20 hr(s) |    5 DASH   |   100 DASH   |                     |\r\n| TC 2       | MS 2     | 10 hr(s) |    5 DASH   |    50 DASH   |                     |\r\n| TC 3       | MS 3     |  4 hr(s) |    5 DASH   |    20 DASH   |                     |\r\n| TC 4       | MS 4     |  2 hr(s) |    5 DASH   |    10 DASH   |                     |\r\n| TC 5       | MS 5     |  5 hr(s) |    5 DASH   |    25 DASH   |                     |\r\n| TC 6       | MS 6     |  0 hr(s) |    5 DASH   |     0 DASH   |                     |\r\n| TC 7       | MS 7     |  3 hr(s) |    5 DASH   |    15 DASH   |                     |\r\n| *Subtotal* |          |          |             |  *220 DASH*  |                     |\r\n| Discount   | 20% off  |          |             |   -44 DASH   | I love dash!        |\r\n| **Total**  |          |          |             | **175 DASH** | rounded down 1 DASH |\r\n\r\n###### Table 4 - Compensation for Community Participation\r\n| Part.

The more financial incentive we can offer the community the better and more expansive the platform and community will become, which will lead to a healthier, more decentralized community.  This platform will be ideal for\r\n\r\n* **developers** (projects that need to host code)\r\n* **writers** (of blogs, guides, etc.)\r\n* marketers or **anyone** who wishes to host community funded files and content on a powerful, transparent platform\r\n\r\n> \"Anyone, with any skill set (software, quality assurance, automation, admin, marketing, legal, etc) is needed.\" - Evan Duffield\r\n",
